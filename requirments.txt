Gemalto: Take home test for Senior Software Developer

Instructions:
Use the Survey Monkeyâ€™s questionnaire example (see https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/customer-satisfaction-survey-template) to create a simple customer survey website. Use the questions and options from the above form. Results should be processed into a database (or datastore). There should also be a small reporting page where we can see the results of the questions and some simple statistics.
 
It's OK to reuse components from the internet. You will be delivering the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) to us as a consultant.
 
There are no limitations what so ever to the techno, use what you feel comfortable with (Github, SVN, NancyFX, java, owin, ruby on rails etc). You'll have to make sure your clients (us) know how to get the deliverable up and running quickly.
